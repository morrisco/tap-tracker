        amber to brown in color, old ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness.
        Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character
        intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character
        of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt
        and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A
        distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often
        for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in
        the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation
        character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl
        character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin
        and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic
        character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present
        but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors
        that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry
        should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This
        style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces
        organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition
        organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.058","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21
