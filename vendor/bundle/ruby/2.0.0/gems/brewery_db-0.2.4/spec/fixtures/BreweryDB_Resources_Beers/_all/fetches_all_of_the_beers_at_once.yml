        gets a unique label and a unique recipe. Although our recipes must remain
        a secret, many save a few bottles from year to year. Properly refrigerated,
        the beer remains intriguing and drinkable for years. Different nuances emerge

        beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers,
        etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from
        subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or
        spices used may not always be identifiable. Under hopping often, but not always,
        allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations
        are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored
        beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a
        \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices
        are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying
        a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is
        a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic
        style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate
        and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21

        Brown Peticolas opened the first Peticolas law firm in the State of Texas.
        After briefly leaving his practice to fight in the Civil War, A.B. returned
        to the practice of law in 1866. Since that time, A.B., his son (Warner Marion),
        grandson (William Craig), great grandson (Edward Kent), and\/or great-great
        grandson ( Michael) have continuously practiced law in the State of Texas.
        \r\n\r\n Named after Alfred Brown Peticolas, our English brown ale is a dialed
        back version of the American interpretation. It\u2019s copper in color with
        a pleasantly light hop aroma, which is balanced with a delicate roasty maltiness.
        Notes of nut and chocolate are subdued, but clearly present in flavor. This
        beer\u2019s body is medium-light and possesses a smooth texture with a hint
        of residual sweetness. \r\n\r\n The roasted characteristics of this beer make
        it the perfect match for any meats or vegetables prepared on the grill.\r\n\r\n
        A little more on A.B. Peticolas? He was born in Richmond, Virginia, on May
        27, 1838. As a young man, he studied law and taught school. He began his practice
        in Virginia, but ultimately moved west to Victoria, Texas. In 1859, he opened
        up a law practice with Samuel A. White. A.B. Peticolas may be best remembered
        today for his published Civil War journals and detailed pencil sketches, having
        served during the Sibley Campaign in New Mexico with Co. C., 4th Regiment,
        Texas Mounted Volunteers. After his discharge in 1865, he returned to Victoria
        to practice law. In 1894, A.B. Peticolas authored an index-digest to all civil
        cases contained in the Texas Report. This catalog became standard text of
        the Texas Bar Association for years. In his later years, A.B. Peticolas was

        Amber\/Red Ale","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper
        to light brown in color. They are characterized by American-variety hops used
        to produce the perception of medium hop bitterness, flavor, and medium aroma.
        Amber ales have medium-high to high maltiness with medium to low caramel character.
        They should have medium to medium-high body. The style may have low levels
        of fruityester flavor and aroma. Diacetyl can be either absent or barely perceived
        at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Slight yeast
        haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21

        Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness,
        is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%)
        of adjuncts. Color may be light straw to golden. Alcohol content and bitterness
        may also be greater. Hop aroma and flavor is low or negligible. Light fruity
        esters are acceptable. Chill haze and diacetyl should be absent. Note: Some
        beers marketed as \"premium\" (based on price) may not fit this definition.","ibuMin":"6","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.3","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21
