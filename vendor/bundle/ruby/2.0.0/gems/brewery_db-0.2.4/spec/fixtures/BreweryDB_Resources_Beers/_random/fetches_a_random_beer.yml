        of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category
        will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines
        and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition
        of the style. Balance of character is a key component when assessing these
        beers. Barrel or wood-aged entries in competitions may be directed to other
        categories by competition director. In competitions the brewer must provide
        the historical or regional tradition of the style, or his interpretation of
        the style, in order to be assessed properly by the judges.","createDate":"2012-03-21
