        Pale Ale dates back to the 1700''s when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship
        to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to
        get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized
        that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane
        I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive
        crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row
        barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result
        is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual
        sweetness.","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        of pine and lemon peel. The pronounced hop bitterness is balanced by a medium-bodied
        caramel and biscuity malt character with a nutty finish.\r\n\r\nTrue to the
        original English version of this style, our India Pale Ale showcases many
        subtle earthy bitter notes, rather than the resinous citrus-rind bite often
        featured in many American-style IPAs. This unique, sessionable brew would
        have surely pleased British troops stationed in faraway lands.\r\nRecommended
